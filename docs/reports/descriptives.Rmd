```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Descriptives
The data was downloaded as excel file *"data/raw/outcomes.xlsx"* from osf. Then, this was processed in *"src/data_preparation.R"*. The output *"data/processed/data_onefile.R"* is here analyzed for descriptives. 

**ATTENTION**: the results have been blinded. 

```{r data, include=FALSE}
source("src/utilities.R")
df <- readRDS(paste0(processed, "data_onefile.RDS"))
```

## Papers, experiments, animals
`r length(unique(df$ID))` publications met our pre-specified inclusion criteria: these used >`r sum(df$nC, na.rm = TRUE) + sum(df$nE, na.rm = TRUE)` animals from `r length(unique(paste(df$ID, df$nest)))` experiments.
